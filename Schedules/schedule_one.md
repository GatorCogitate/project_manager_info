# Schedule One - February 11, 2020

## Research Dependencies 
Each team for their **tool** will create a list of dependencies for their tool. This will be used to create the unified files for the Cogitate tool. During this time teams can also finish organizing their demos if necessary. Project managers will meet to begin creating a Travis CI build system for the project.

## Presentation of Demos
Each team will present a demo for the tool that they were assigned, according to
using them in the context of our software engineering project. 

- [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
- [PyDriller](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [StreamLit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## Tool Evaluation 
This should take less than 10 minutes. Take time for a brief evaluation of each of the tools to answer the following questions:

- _Are there any tools that we should **not** include in our Cogitate tool?_
 
## Break into Teams

- Individual Metrics (table 1)
- Team Interactions (table 2)
- Testing and Building (table 3)
- Overall Evaluation (table 4)

If you do not remember which team you are a part of this can be found in
`teams_roster.md`. Project managers are responsible for creating slack channels
for their teams.

<!-- Each team should **elect a representative** to work on creating a code base that
will access data from GitHub to use as a basis for our team features. While
representatives are working, the teams will discuss features. This should be
completed by **2/13/2020 by midnight**. -->

Assign software architecture leaders for each team. 

## Determine Team Features
Each team should discuss the questions at hand for their specific team (found in
`teams_roster.md`) and devise a list of **specific** features that will be built
on a per team basis. This concrete list of features is due 
**by the end of lab, 2/11/2020**.

## Pitch Team Features 
Each team should elect a representative (not the project manager) to present their
team's features at their table. This should take **one to two minutes**. There
will be time for quick discussion for feedback after each presentation.

## Work Within Teams

- Create a plan and schedule for the upcoming week with deadlines. This should be
submitted to the project manager **by the end of lab, 2/11/2020**. 
- Create GitHub issues to describe the features that each team will create.
- Create demos to be presented to the customer **during the next lab session, 2/18
2020**. There should be working code and test cases for the features. A PR for
each branch should be created by **2/17/2020 at noon**.

The procedure for creating a new feature of a project is addressed in the tenth question of `management.md`.
