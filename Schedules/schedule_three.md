# Schedule Three - February 25, 2020

## Announcements

Project managers will take time to make announcements and begin the laboratory session, any questions from the customer can be asked and answered at this time.

### Travis CI

Work is still being done on the Travis CI file in branch `Improve/travis-ci` the link to the branch is [here](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool/tree/Improve/travis-ci). This should be completed as soon as possible, and we are working dilligently to accomplish this essential task. If you can provide insight, you can comment in the `Improve Travis CI Configuration` [issue](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool/issues/30).

### Dependencies

All `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock` and `.gitignore` files existing in each branch/PR have been added to the files in the `New_dependencies` branch. This branch will be merged into `master`. From this step, each team's branch should remove their existing files (as their data has been added to the `New_dependencies` branch) and `master` should be merged into each branch.

**Please note that the `master` branch can be merged into your branches with the command `git pull download master`.**

### Data File and Folder Systems

An explanation of the data file folder system will be given. A folder system has been merged to the `master` branch. This system includes `data`, `src` and `tests` folders. For each branch to recieve this system, `master` should be merged into each branch.

**Please note that the `master` branch can be merged into your branches with the command `git pull download master`.**

### Formatting

Please be sure that code is being formatted in a explicit and descriptive way. Docstrings can help us, as engineers to understand the purpose of the code that is being written. We are working to create files to formating linting, which will then be checked as Travis CI is fixed.

### Task Reassignment

In order to ensure progress in our `Cogitate` tool, teams will be reassigned to work on different tasks. `Team Interactions` will be working on implementing a **full** command line interface. `Testing and Building` will be working on implementing a **full** web interface. `Overall Evaluation` and `Individual Metrics` will continue working on features, to ensure that all customer requirements are meant, and that features are tested, and documented.



## Closing Issues

Please take some time to work within our teams to work on closing [issues](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool/issues). For our `Cogitate` tool, there are currently 12 issues open, it would be appreciated if we could close those that are now unnecessary.
