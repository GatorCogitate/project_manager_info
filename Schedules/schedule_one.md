# Schedule One - February 11, 2020

## Presentation of Demos
Each team will present a demo for the tool that they were assigned, according to
using them in the context of our software engineering project. 

- [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
- [PyDriller](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [StreamLit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Command Line Interfaces

## Tool Evaluation 
This should take less than 10 minutes. Take time for a brief evaluation of each of the tools to answer the following questions:

- Are there any tools that we should **not** include in our Cogitate tool?
- What are the dependencies for these tools? Can we get a list of these asap?
 
## Break into Teams

- Individual Metrics (table 1)
- Team Interactions (table 2)
- Testing and Building (table 3)
- Overall Evaluation (table 4)

If you do not remember which team you are a part of this can be found in
`teams_roster.md`. Project managers are responsible for creating slack channels
for their teams. 

Each team should **elect a representative** to work on creating a code base that
will access data from GitHub to use as a basis for our team features. While
representatives are working, the teams will discuss features. This should be
completed by **2/13/2020 by midnight**.

## Determine Team Features
Each team should discuss the questions at hand for their specific team (found in
`teams_roster.md`) and devise a list of **specific** features that will be built
on a per team basis. This concrete list of features is due 
**by the end of lab, 11/2020**.

## Pitch Team Features 
Each team should elect a representative (not the project manager) to present their
team's features at their table. This should take **one to two minutes**. There
will be time for quick discussion for feedback after each presentation.

## Work Within Teams

- create a plan and schedule for the upcoming week with deadlines. This should be
submitted to the project manager **by the end of lab, 2/11/2020**. 
- Create GitHub issues to describe the features that each team will create.
- Create demos to be presented to the customer **during the next lab session, 2/18
2020**. There should be working code and test cases for the features. A PR for
each branch should be created by **2/17/2020 at noon**.
