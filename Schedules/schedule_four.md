# Schedule Four - March 2, 2020

## Announcements

Project managers will take time to make announcements and begin the laboratory session, any questions from the customer can be asked and answered at this time.

## One More Week

Please remember that project managers are asking for a finished tool by the end of lab next week **3/10/2020**. This means that there is only one week left to complete what needs to be finished by each of the teams. If anyone needs assistance with anything this can be raised with your team, a project manager, or the entire class if necessary.

## Team Progress

Teams will be asked to provide a short status update on their progress concerning their tasks. They will have an opportunity to explain what has been done, still needs to be done, and if there is any help required to finish their tasks.

Teams can also give feedback to other teams on how to best continue if necessary. These discussions should be held to 5 to 8 minutes.

Teams who have moved on to work on the command line interface, and web interface should give an overview of what features they created before reassignment, and what is necessary to complete these features.

## Questions and Answers

Teams will be given the opportunity to speak to the customer about their features or interfaces and any modifications that should be made. This is not necessary, but the customer will be available if any questions should arise.

## Closing Issues

Please take some time to work within our teams to work on closing [issues](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool/issues). For our `Cogitate` tool, there are currently 12 issues open, it would be appreciated if we could close those that are now unnecessary.

## Work Within Teams

Work within your teams to complete a weekly schedule, and also develop new features/fix feature issues or begin working on implementing interfaces. A weekly schedule is **not due this week** but teams should still create a schedule to ensure the completion of tasks. This is also a time to discuss with TLs about any pressing issues, and to ask the customer any questions regarding the tool that is being created.

The features teams and interface teams should collaborate together to:

- Discuss how to complete the features that interface teams were working on

- What features the features teams have created/are creating and how they can be
  displayed in an interface

- Any assistance that the teams can provide to each other going forward

## Assign Tasks to Team Members

Teams should work together to ensure that **every** team member has a task for the upcoming week to ensure the **completion** of their team's task. If a member is not given a task, or is unsure of their responsibility, they should **ask their project manager** about what should be done.

## Deadlines
